      "The Hi-Lo system (High-Low) is simple and straightforward.
      It is a BALANCED system, the count, if counted correctly
      should start at 0 and end with 0.
      Since it is BALANCED, for more accurate information, the
      running count will be converted to the true count or the
      running count divided by the remaning decks.

      2, 3, 4, 5, 6	count +1
      7, 8, 9	count 0
      10, J, Q, K, A	count -1
      
      Keep track of cards from the beginning or the final count
      will not be accurate. 
      When the count is POSITIVE they are
      in an advantageous state, and so the bet should be
      increased, the deck is more rich in HIGH value cards.
      When the count is NEGATIVE, they do not have an edge and
      should refrain from increasing the wagers, the deck is rich 
      in LOW value cards (Bet the least)."

      "The K-O system (Knockout Count) gives players the
      opportunity to make wiser decisions for their moves and bets.
      It is both simple and effective.
      This strategy is very similar to the popular Hi-Lo system 
      which is very convenient for players who are already 
      familiar with this basic card counting method. The only 
      number that has a different assigned value than the Hi-Lo 
      system is seven.Another very important classification the 
      card counting systems have is whether they are balanced 
      or unbalanced ones. In contrast to the Hi-Lo system which is 
      a balanced one, the K-O system falls into the category of the 
      UNBALANCED systems. Which means afterthe whole deck(s) are 
      played the final number (count) WILL NOT be 0.

      2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7	count +1
      8, 9	count 0
      10, J, Q, K, A	count -1
      
      Prior to playing, it is crucial to pay attention at the 
      number of decks involved in the game as they will determine the count 
      players should begin with. The STARTING COUNT IS CALCULATED this way:
      
      4 - (4 x the number of decks in play)
      
      So, the starting count is 0 for a single-deck game, -4 for a 
      double-deck game, and -20 for a six-deck game. In other words, the 
      higher the number of decks in play, the lower the starting count is.
      Another important thing is that if a player counts correctly through 
      a deck of cards, their FINAL COUNT will always be +4
      
      ADJUSTING BETS goes like this:
      Once the count becomes a positive value (at least +2), players can 
      increase their bet size to 2 or more units.This is the most crucial 
      moment in the game, when the odds shift in players' favor. This is 
      when using the KO count in a SINGLE-DECK game, we should wait for the 
      running count to become +2 to raise our bets. When we play a DOUBLE-DECK 
      game, however, we increase the bets when the running count is +1. This is
      called the “key count” or “pivot count” and it varies, depending 
      on the number of decks used:"

      Number on the right is the key count, which is when you should increase
      your bet when the count becomes that number:

      1 deck   2
      2 decks  1
      6 decks -4
      8 decks -6

      There is one more thing players should change, except for adjusting their 
      bet size,when using the Knock Out method. They can, and should according to the 
      creators of the system, deviate from the standard strategy with regards to the 
      Insurance side bet. The basic strategy says never to take INSURANCE but KO 
      allows it under the perfect circumstances:
      only if the running count is +3 or greater.

      "The Ace Five blackjack strategy is one of the simplest forms of card counting 
      in the game of 21. All you need to do is keep track of 2 cards - Aces and Fives.

      The Ace Five card count works under a similar premise, except it narrows it 
      down to just two cards. Aces are easily the best card you can get. Not only 
      are they necessary for a natural blackjack, but they're worth a lot either way. 
      Getting to 17+ without going over 21 is much easier with an Ace on the table. 
      Moreover, if you happen to go over anyway, they can be worth 1 as well, which 
      gives you some room to take risks you otherwise shouldn't. Combined with the 
      blackjack basic strategy, stacking the deck with aces is a considerable advantage.
      Conversely, fives are easily one of the worst cards you can draw. Even with an 
      Ace, they'll only get you to 16, which is relatively easy for the dealer to beat.
      However, you're more likely to end up in the 11-15 range after the 
      first two cards, which is not where you want to be.
      Hence, the idea is simple - you keep track of the Aces and Fives. 

      If there are more Aces left in the shoe, you raise the stakes. 
      If there are more fives, you keep them low.

      Ace count -1
      5 count +1

      If the running count is 1 or smaller, make the minimum bet. 
      Yes, this also extends to negative running counts.

      If the count is AT 2 or more, double your previous stake. If the count 
      is still positive on the following round, double it again. You can keep 
      raising the stakes as long as the count is BIGGER than 2 and the odds 
      are in your favor. Of course, you still shouldn't go over the maximum 
      - money management is still a factor.

      If the court ever drops below 2, revert to the minimum stake.

      The system was designed for classic 6-8 deck variants available at most casinos. 
      As long as your decisions follow a reliable blackjack strategy chart, the 
      probabilities will be in your favor.

      The Ace/Five card counting system gives the player a 0.30-0.50%
      advantage over the house."
